Each translatable resource should have a star added to the beginning of the resource string. Shake your phone to switch between the original and the test versions. If the translation scope is ok then your app is ready for On-device resource localization.

**Note for Android Studio version 1.1 users**: 
In case you are using Android Studio version 1.1.x and run into error "Error:No such property: bootClasspath for class: com.android.build.gradle.AppPlugin" when building your project then please **follow this workaround** until we fix the issue.

**Modify the gradle version from 1.1.0 to 1.0.0** in your project's build.gradle file.

When the build.gradle file is modfied by the Android Studio plugin it contains the following section

```groovy
    ...
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.1.0'
    ...
```

that should be changed as follows

```groovy
    ...
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:1.0.0'
    ...
```

Please carry out a clean build of your project. This workaround should solve the above compilation error.

After you start your app - language manager screen appears: choose developer mode from the menu.




Then in your app all your translatable resources will have a star added to the beginning of the resource string. 
Shake your phone to switch between the original and the test versions. 

Your app is ready for On-device resource localization.
